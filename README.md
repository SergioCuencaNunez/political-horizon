## See the Whole Picture, Not Just a Fragment

Political Horizon is a web application designed to analyze and mitigate bias in political news recommender systems. It leverages **Machine Learning (ML)** and **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques to promote diverse and balanced news consumption. The platform integrates **content-based filtering**, **diversity-aware re-ranking techniques**, and **controlled exposure strategies** to enhance fairness in news recommendations.

## Features

- **Unbiased News Curation**:
  - Identifies and mitigates bias in news recommendation algorithms.
  - Analyzes bias patterns using **exploratory data analysis (EDA)**.

- **Fair & Transparent Recommendations**:
  - Implements **Controlled Exposure Strategies** for balanced news delivery.
  - Uses **Diversity-Aware Re-ranking Techniques** to break ideological echo chambers.

- **Comprehensive Data Insights**:
  - Works with the **POLUSA dataset** (900,000 political news articles with political leanings).
  - Evaluates fairness using **Shannon Entropy** and **Gini Index**.

- **Seamless User Experience**:
  - Built with **React + Vite** for speed and interactivity.
  - Styled with **Chakra UI** for a clean and accessible interface.
